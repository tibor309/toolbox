## Setup
### Replit and Glitch
First clone the repo with the buttons on top, or manually on the site. Then head over to the secrets tab, and create a new secret called `TOKEN`, and place your bot token in the value field. After that just install the packages, and you're done!

### Source
Clone the repo, and install all the required packages with the command below. Then create a secrets file, and set your bot token. After that, just run it somewhere, or change the configuration in the config file. Soon there will be a docker image too!
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration
You can change a few things in the config file. You can change the date format for logging, icons, embed colors, ect.
