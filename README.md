## Setup
### Replit and Glitch
First clone the repo with the buttons on top, or manually on the site. Then head over to the secrets tab, and create a new secret called `TOKEN`, and place your bot token in the value field. Install all the packages using the command below, and you're done!

### Source
Clone the repo, and install all the required packages with the command below. At least python 3.10 is required!
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then create a secrets file, and set your bot token. After that, run the but with this command:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

## Docker
You can also run the bot with docker, but you won't be able to customize the configuration. Simply run the command below:

```bash
docker run -d -it -e TOKEN=your-bot-token tibor309/toolbox:latest
```

## Configuration
You can customize the bot in the config file. You can change the date format for logging, icons, embed colors, ect.
